README

This repository contains a properly configured CMakeLists.txt to run the FLTK library correctly when working with Chapters 12-16 of Stroustrup's C++ Programming and Practice. 
You can also find a unbuilded FLTK library in FLTKfolder/fltk-1.3.9.

I used the MSYS package manager to download and install the FLTK library.
" $ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-fltk "

Enjoy the learning c++ with Stroustrup!

Environtment: 	MSYS
