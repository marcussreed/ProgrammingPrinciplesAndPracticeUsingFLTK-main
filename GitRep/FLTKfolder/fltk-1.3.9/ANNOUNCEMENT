The initial FLTK 1.3.0 is based on the final 1.1.10.

  It adds internationalization, UTF-8 (Unicode), printing support,
  Doxygen based documentation, and several new widgets including
  Fl_Native_File_Chooser, Fl_Table, and Fl_Tree.

FLTK 1.3.9 and previous versions contain many improvements and bug fixes.

  Please see CHANGES for a list of changes in FLTK 1.3.0 to 1.3.9.

  FLTK 1.3.9 is a maintenance release with minor enhancements and
  some macOS related improvements.

  macOS is now supported up to macOS 14 (Sonoma).

  CMake support has been enhanced and requires CMake 3.15 or higher,
  autotools/configure/make and bundled IDE projects are still supported.

  Note: This file is a snapshot of https://www.fltk.org/roadmap.php
  as of release 1.3.6 (May 15, 2021). Please take into account that some
  bugs and/or feature requests in this list might have been fixed without
  notice. It is intentional that this is an older version.

  Bugs and feature requests for FLTK 1.4.x may also apply to FLTK 1.3.9.

FLTK 1.3.9 is expected to be the last release in the 1.3.x series.

  All bug reports for 1.3.x will be fixed in FLTK 1.4.x if possible.

Note to Git users: This branch (branch-1.3) is end of life since the
release of FLTK 1.3.4. Only very serious bug fixes will be available
if FLTK 1.4.0 is not yet released or not (yet) stable enough.

The current development branch is 'master' -- please checkout a new,
clean working copy if you want to get FLTK 1.4 (master).
